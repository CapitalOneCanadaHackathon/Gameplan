Most of us have financial goals, but a lot of the time we don't know what moves we should be making towards achieving them. When it comes to things like saving for retirement or getting out of debt, it is easy to become to become overwhelmed and put off taking action.

GAMEPLAN takes the stress out of financial planning by helping you move towards your goals through accessible modules and simple tasks. By using the visual metaphor of running around baseball bases or dribbling towards a basket, GAMEPLAN allows users to quickly see how far they are from a goal, making planning fun and satisfying, while emphasizing that reaching goals requires continued momentum (as with success in sport).

GAMEPLAN delivers customized plans based on each user's individual situation and goals, so users aren't tasked with sifting through information and can get the advice they need in minutes. Saving for retirement isn't so overwhelming when the first steps are reading a few paragraphs and depositing $5 in an account.

While Prosper Canada has great resources for planners, our goal was to make these resources approachable and accessible for the general public, and get people excited about money matters.
